## Abstract

Creating reproducible scientific research has been a goal of the academic community for as long as I have been a part of it and has seen great successes (such as the [interactive Nature article](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) and [LIGO Gravitation wave analysis](https://losc.ligo.org/s/events/GW150914/GW150914_tutorial.html)), in part due to the efforts of the Python (and Jupyter) community. But I like to believe that these efforts stem from a more human root cause to understand the world around us and as such should be relevant to anyone (not just the scientific Python community) trying to communicate the results of research.

In this talk give a brief history on why (and how) we need to make all of our analyses reproducible and how (web based) interactive visualizations are essential to making research much more accessible to the world at large. By creating a reusable (and extensible) chart using the [Lightning](http://lightning-viz.org/) visualization library I will highlight the role visualization plays in making analyses accessible to others and how web based technologies such as Javascript and D3 can liberate our results from the static prison of PDFs. And along the way I will (hopefully) show you the potential of interaction to change the hearts and minds of (colleagues) and the world.

<!-- ## Talk

### Why Reproducible, why now?

#### Benefits of Reproducible Research

#### What we currently have

**General Purpose**

* matplotlib: baseline
* ggplot: easier to use but not interactive
* seaborn: ditto
* bokeh: web++, need to spin up own server
* plotly: used to be you have to send data to their servers
* D3: hard to use, low level
* Vega (and Vega-lite): close, almost there!

**Products (and Companies)**

* Github
* Figshare
* Etc.

#### What we need

**The Tenets of Reproducibility, The Hierarchy of Accessibility**

* Can I see it?
* Can I touch (interact with) it?
* Can I hold it (download code + data)?
* Can I copy it (repeat)?
* Can I extend it?

### How Reproducible?

**Current State**

* [Peer Reviewed Journals](http://www.jstor.org/) (open access with [Sci-Hub](https://sci-hub.io/))
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/): Reproducible analyses
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/): Portable Development Environments
* [Binder](http://mybinder.org/): Executable Analyses
* [Lightning-Viz](http://lightning-viz.org/): Extensible Visualizations
* [PubPub](http://pubpub.media.mit.edu/): Open Publishing

**The Components of Reproducibility**

* Mobile?
* Interaction
