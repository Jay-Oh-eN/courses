This second project will focus on creating interactive maps!

__Project Due Tuesday 5/3 at **3pm** and the peer critiques will be due 5/5.__

## Requirements

### Part 1: Base Map

For part 1 you will focus on creating the base geographic layer for your map (think topo/geojson).

<!-- For your map you are required to visualize a [municipality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality) (city or town but **NOT country or World**). -->

0. Pick a region to visualize. Here is a list of open data on many cities around the world: [http://dataportals.org/](http://dataportals.org/)
1. Find the required geographic files you will use for your specific map. Here are resources/repositories on geojson (if you choose to go down that route):
    * [More than you ever wanted to know about Geojson](http://www.macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html)
    [https://github.com/tmcw/awesome-geojson#data](https://github.com/tmcw/awesome-geojson#data)
    * [jsongeo](https://github.com/jsongeo)
    * [geojson and git](http://maptimesea.github.io/2014/12/03/git-geojson.html)
    * [world.geo.json](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json)

2. Create the geographic layer (city/town boundaries, etc.) for your visualization. For the example from class this would correspond to the city of SF.

### Part 2: Thematic Layer

For this second part you will decide on the [thematic layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_map) for your map. The thematic layer corresponds to the data usually.

1. Determine which thematic map style suits your data best. Here is a list of common types: [http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/gisx/resources/maps4.html](http://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/gisx/resources/maps4.html)
2. Apply the thematic style to your data.
3. Place the thematic layer on top of your geographic layer. For the example from class this would correspond to the static bubbles corresponding to the number of listings per neighborhood.

### Part 3: Interaction

For part 3 you will add a layer of interaction to make your map more interpretable.

1. This part is fairly dependent on the data and thematic layer chosen, but common interactions include (does **NOT** have to be implemented in D3 but cannot be a product like CartoDB):
    * [Map hover + Tooltip](http://bl.ocks.org/lhoworko/7753a11efc189a936371)
    * [Details on Demand using Zoom](http://abshinn.github.io/mind-the-gap/)
    * [Linked Charts](http://bl.ocks.org/jay-oh-en/b8ef4734abad1c644221)

## Submission

Again, you will be submitting this project as a Gist on Canvas.

## Peer Critique

For this project you will also perform a peer critique after the initial submission deadline. More on the format of the critique on Tuesday after initial projects have been submitted.

After the critique you will publicly post you visualization to blocks and your Github pages portfolio site.

### How to Critique

For this first peer critique please read these two articles to understand how to be as effective (and constructive) in your feedback.

  * [Some words about constructive criticism](http://www.thefunctionalart.com/2014/08/some-words-about-constructive-criticism.html)
