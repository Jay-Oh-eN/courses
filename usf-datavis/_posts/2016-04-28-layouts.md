    - Cluster
    - tree
    - pack

    - What's humble pie? 

facets (what is the __best__ neighborhood to stay in):
* review cleanliness, etc.
* beds, accomodates, etc.
* host reviews/ratings, response rate, response time etc.


I would be remiss if I didn't show you a force diagram. unfortunately they are not the most practical for a data scientist (if you have a network it is often too big to show in a force diagram, and if it is not too big it probably isn't too interesting) and often overused... so we won't be covering them.

## Exercise: Remix a Layout

1. Fork the following [bl.ock](http://bl.ocks.org/Jay-Oh-eN/c0080393998211fa0f9b6c98579678c7)
2. Adapt the code to use an alternative [hierarchical layout](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Hierarchy-Layout)
3. Work on Project 3!
